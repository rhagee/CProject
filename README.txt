PROJECT README :


1. Open Terminal in the directory where the "makefile" is.
2. Digit your favourite way to execute the code :
   - make all -> Just Compile and put files in sub-directories
   - make run -> Compile and Execute Automatically the code
   - make run_clean -> Compile and Execute Automatically, after a NORMAL termination , it deletes the Exe and .o files
   - make clean -> Just Clean sub-directories

Sub-Directories : 

exe : Contains Executables and Settings.txt for the game
lib : Contains the libraries
src : Source Container, contains all the C programs and the file "settings.txt" (EDIT THERE THE FILE TO GET THE NEW OPTIONS DONE IF YOU COMPILE AGAIN)

If you want to Execute the program with the "./name" command, and there is the "settings.txt" inside "exe" folder, you can change it there.

END FILE.
